# Data Preparation

This directory contains the scripts and notebook used to generate the input data for the experiments, including base survey models, wavelet extraction, and the synthesis of angle-dependent seismic images.

## Base Survey Models and Wavelet Extraction

The notebook `data_prep.ipynb` documents the complete workflow for:

- Generating base survey reservoir models
- Extracting seismic wavelets from the base survey
- Preparing reference models used in subsequent forward modeling

This notebook provides a transparent and reproducible description of the preprocessing steps applied prior to seismic synthesis.

## Synthesis of Angle-Dependent Seismic Data

The script `generate_input.py` is used to synthesize the full set of angle-dependent seismic images that serve as input data for the learning and inversion workflows.

Specifically, the script:
- Generates synthetic seismic responses for multiple incidence angles
- Produces angle-dependent seismic gathers consistent with the base survey models
- Saves the resulting data in NumPy (`.npy`) format for direct use in training and evaluation

## Output
The outputs generated by the scripts in this directory are organized and stored in the dataset structure provided in the accompanying Zenodo archive.

For details on the final dataset layout and access instructions, please refer to the dataset `README.md`.
